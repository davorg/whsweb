        <h2>About The Wandsworth Historical Society
        </h2>

        <p>The Wandsworth Historical Society aims to promote an interest in the history and archaeology of the Borough of Wandsworth.

           throughout the year, as well as archaeological field trips along the Thames foreshore. 
           There are also occasional visits to places of interest.
        </p>
        <p>The Society encourages new research, much of which appears in its journal, 
           <i><a href="historian/historian.htm">Wandsworth Historian</a>.</i>
        </p>
        <p>More detailed research is published in a series of Wandsworth Papers, and some members have also written books on a variety of topics.
