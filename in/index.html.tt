          January 2017 - Britain's historians hear about Battersea's estates
        </h3>

        <p>We are proud to report that Keith Bailey, a long-standing member of the Society and a regular contributor to the <i>Historian</i>, has achieved national prominence with the recent publication of a scholarly study on the expansion of inner-city housing two hundred years ago.
    	</p>
	    <p>Keith's essay is entitled '"The Richest Crop that it can Grow": building estate development in nineteenth-century Battersea', and it appears in the latest issue of <i>The Local Historian</i>, the much respected journal of the British Association for Local History. Without doubt this is a significant addition to the current literature on the evolution of Britain's urban environment.

      <br>

      <p>In 1787 the significant landowner, the second Earl Spencer, commissioned the cartographer, John Corris, to draw a plan of all his holdings and rights within the parish of Wandsworth. The result is the most detailed map we have of the area in the Georgian period, with many of the parcels of land meticulously marked and all the buildings shown to a sound accuracy even in the built-up area. As part of its remit to widen people's knowledge of Wandsworth's past the WHS has published a careful reproduction of the original in the British Library, printed in full colour and measuring 41cm by 47cm.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p><strong>Copies cost just &pound;5 post free,</strong> and are available by sending a cheque for that amount to WHS, 20 Cromer Villas Road, London SW18 1PN. Please make your cheque payable to the 'Wandsworth Historical Society' and remember to include your full address.
